# Changelog

Each version of parsed, newest first.

A **Breaking** line means a command, a flag, an output or a policy file written for the version before may fail, or
behave differently.

The top entry, while it reads *unreleased*, collects what has merged for the next version; each change adds its own
lines as it lands, and the entry is dated when that version is released.

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

**Read-only access to a zeared mesh, typed by its protocol and guarded by a policy file.**

### Added

- **The project:** the `parsed` command (also `python -m parsed`). `--version` names the seared and zeared it runs
  on, since a protocol package parsed reads must pin the same zeared. The house toolchain gates every commit:
  `ruff`, `deptry` and `ty` as `prek` hooks, and a hook that refuses a commit on `master`. A merge to `master` that
  changes the version tags the release.
- **Dependencies:** seared `>=0.4.3,<0.5` and zeared `>=0.4.3,<0.5`, pinned to `tag = "v0.4.3"` each.
